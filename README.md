# fidget-pcb

This is a fidget toy PCB that I made in Kicad. The layout currently is rectangular, but if you change the arrangement and print on 6 different PCBs, it should be possible to create a fidget cube.

There are 6 different modules, each of which has a different function:
- 6 different LEDs turn on if you press a button
- The buzzer activates if you press a button
- Two potentiometers, one of which controls the intensity of the LEDs and the other one the intensity of the buzzer
- A photo resistor that sounds the buzzer when blocked
- Two buttons, which when pressed at the same time, activate the LEDs
- Four buttons that are there for the clicky sound
